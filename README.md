It is not a direct fork, but while writing it, I was looking into several others repositories, such as:
  
  - [SeleniumMavenProject](https://github.com/shashankgupta5/SeleniumMavenProject) by shashankgupta5
  - [Selenium-Maven-Template](https://github.com/Ardesco/Selenium-Maven-Template) by Ardesco

## Usage

Since it's a personal playground I suggest to avoid using this repository. But if you want - feel free.
